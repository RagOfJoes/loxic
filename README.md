# Tree-Walk Interpreter for Lox written in C

My code that follows along the book: [Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). The code here translates the Java code that's presented in the book to C.

## Why?

To learn more about interpreters, compilers, and C. I also just wanted to work on a side project that has nothing to do with what I do at work.
